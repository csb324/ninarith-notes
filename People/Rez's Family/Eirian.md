### Background
[[Rez]] and [[Vask]]'s sister. Silver dragon.

### Who're They to Us?
[[Rez]] asked [[Vask]] if he knew of any parts of [[Rez's Family]] in [[Thelran Asari]] - he thought [[Eirian]] was. So [[Rez]] used the [[Circlet of Sending]] to ask her help stopping [[Burru Ilp]] before he spread information on [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]. [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] was unhappy on with [[Rez]], but hey [[Eirian]] said she'd help!
