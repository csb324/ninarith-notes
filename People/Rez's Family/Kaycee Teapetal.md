[Race::Halfling]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home:: the [[Rotted Grotto]], [[The Shadowfell]]
[Affiliation::[[The Zumbinis]]
[Affiliation:: [[Mr. Blueberry]]
[Affiliation:: [[Rez's Family]]

Met [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] in the [[Turian Waste]] at one of [[Mr. Blueberry]]'s skylights. Turns out, she's [[Kaycee Teapetal|Rez's Mom]]! Kicked [[Hugh|Finn]] and [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]]'s ass, spoiled [[Rez]]'s secret, invited us to the [[Rotted Grotto]], and then moved the swamp somewhere less problematic.
