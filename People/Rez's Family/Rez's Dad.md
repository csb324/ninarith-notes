# Rez's Dad
[Status::alive]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::friend]
[Home::[[Taleem]]]
[Affiliation::[[Rez's Family]]]

He's some kind of diplomat. He used to be an adventurer - he's a warlock, it seems. He travels around the continent. He has met a red Firbolg. 

And, of course, he's the father of [[Rez]] and [[Vask]].
