An older halfling man short salt pepper hair missing middle finger right hand. He isnâ€™t from [[Eberron]],  he was a member of the [[Thelran Asari Army]].
### Background
A strategist who developed a way to saying the strategy comes from hunting animals.
### Who're They To Us?
One of [[Grishomec Teld|Major Teld]]'s inner circle, related to [[Don't Tell Teld]].

### How'd he die?

Teld speaks, "Now that we have the rest of the battalion, it is time to meet out just deserts. The lieutenant was given a task. The task was to root out terrorists seeking to destroy our country. He was given free reign to determine how this task was accomplished because of his significant experience.. his excellence in the field. The lieutenant failed. Hundreds are dead because of his mismanagement, his idiocy, and his incompetence." Fingers stomps her foot, and shields and feed from the crowd stomp in time. Teld continues, "For the crime of incompetence, lieutenant, today I sentence you to death." He then coup de gras' Dradleston, bisecting him with an axe.
