# Captain Kalorek Plunderov
[Status::alive]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Viliki]]]

A member of the [[Eberronian Second Division]], overseeing the military garrison in [[Viliki]]. He's delegated the illegal-necromancy investigation to [[Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim]], because he's busy dealing with an unusually aggressive group of Harpies.
