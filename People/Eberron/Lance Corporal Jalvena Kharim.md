# Lance Corporal Jalvena Kharim
[Status::dead]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Viliki]]]
Pronuncation: *whole*-veena 

Reports to [[Captain Kalorek Plunderov]]. Leading the military side of the [[Getting Freaky in Viliki|illegal necromancy investigation]]. She has medium blonde hair, pale, and carries two swords. 

Her first instinct is that [[Shari's Boys]] are behind it. But she also thinks if they'd all been tougher on crime when the boys were mere children, this wouldn't have happened.
