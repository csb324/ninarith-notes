# Security Director Aldi
[Status::dead]
[Race::unknown]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Viliki]]]

The civilian security director in [[Viliki]]. [[notes-98|We tried to meet with him]], but his door was locked (and being watched by what appeared to be military guards). Weird!

Turns out, he was having an affair with [[Shari]], of [[Shari's Boys]]. Executed at the [[Burbank Compound]].
