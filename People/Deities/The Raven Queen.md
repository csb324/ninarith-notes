# The Raven Queen
[Status::deity]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[The Shadowfell]]]

The most recent ascended god. She is the god of death, and specifically, the moment of passage from life to afterlife. 

She and [[Costi]] seem to have some sort of arrangement, but it's unclear what. 

[[Costi]] finds himself drifting through the void, before a voice rumbles through him, "The days ahead are dark, [[Costi|Constantine]]. Things are not as they seem. Those you wish to trust, must be questioned. We'll need discernment more now than ever. If you return, return and keep the moment pure. And keep the world together."
