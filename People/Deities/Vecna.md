# Vecna
[Status::unknown]
[Race::unknown]

A lich? A god? [[Magister]] mentioned this to us. 

We saw evidence of his worship in the [[Necromantic Underground Chapel]].

Someone named M, or [[Morthos]], believed to be a high-elf and one of the few survivors of [[Guâ€™athrithen]] was rumored to be trying to unseat [[Vecna]] as the god of death. It appears he failed, at least [[Vecna]] still exists.
