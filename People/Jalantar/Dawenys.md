[Status::alive]
[Race::wood-elf]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Affiliation::[[Church of Corellon Larethian]]]
[Location:: [[Corellon's Grove]]]
[Pronouns:: she/her]

A female shorter wood-elf with dark hair pulled back from her face. Wears dark, almost black clothing, with a prominent symbol of [[Corellon Larethian]]. Does most of the undergound development and plant care at the [[Corellon's Grove]]. 

### Background
Had a fling with [[Lorian]], likes to tease him about it. Has always lived in [[Jalantar]], but doesn't seem to be a huge fan. Likes the wilderness. 

### Who're they to us? 
Asked for her help with the [[Summoning Stone]], she sent a mean note to the [[Temple of Pelor in Jalantar]] asking them to pay attention, signed as "Dawnfather Melfin"

Told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] she’s one of Corellan’s Favored, and passed along the reply to her message to the [[Temple of Corellon Outside Quaath]]

[[Lorian]] says she's fickle.
