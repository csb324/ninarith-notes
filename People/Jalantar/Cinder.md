# Cinder
[Status::alive]
[Race::half-orc]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Affiliation:: [[Fire Raisers]]]
[Location:: [[The Furnace]]]
[Pronouns:: he/his]

Young looking half-orc with a red and orange breastplate. Short blond hair that looks self-cut, with a sword strapped to his back. Carries a few scars on his face. 

Leader in the [[Fire Raisers]] that seems to be in charge of [[The Furnace]]. Thanked us for freeing Niko, wants to help pay us back. 

### Background 
Was a fisherman in [[Kazdi]] (a town in [[Arkhosia]] that no longer exits. Most of the land was confiscated by Circler Ichlior and turned it into a private resort). He spent a few years in the military, then tried to get into politics but found it impossible to do so, because he's just some guy. Instead, he and his friends joined the [[Fire Raisers]] very early. He wasn't a *founder*, but he was probably a *founding member*.

### Who's he to us? 
Helping our party with the political unseating we're doing for the [[Fire Raisers]]

Leading the effort to reward us for saving [[Niko]] in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]

Hired us for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]] 

Heard from [[Srictha]] that he's been unhappy in [[The Furnace]] lately. Oversaw lots of new recruits, and really counts [[Winifey]] as his right hand. Might also be working with the [[Dragon's Hide]]?
