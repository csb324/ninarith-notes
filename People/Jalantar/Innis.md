# Innis

[Status::alive]
[Race::Half-Elf]
[Relationship::friend]
[Home::[[Jalantar]]]
[Workplace::[[The Fiddlers Respite]]]
[Class::Paladin]

A slender half-elf woman, in nice clothes with long hair, met [[The Unforged Few]] returning home from making a delivery.

A paladin who takes no shit. Traveled with [[Rez]] and [[Adrienne Spout]] and [[Livia]] on the road through the [[Vrolbekk Forest]]. Tangled with some [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Pixies]] on the road. [[Vrolbekk Pixies|Bel]] was particularly a fan.

She runs a brothel called [[The Fiddlers Respite]] in [[Jalantar]], whose workers include [[Qik]] and Pendra.

Played by Joe's friend Maraid! 

When [[Qik]] was arrested by the [[Zalevi Military]], Innis joined us to [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in|help break her out]].
