# Rhy Zahn
[Status::alive]
[Race::Halfing]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Affiliation::[[The Talon]]]
[Location::[[Jalantar]]]

Younger red headed halfling. Reporter at [[The Talon]] 

Seems to be very familiar with [[Vigo Underswell]], and due to a sneaky casting of message it seems to he has leverage on him. 

### Who Is He to Us?
Did a brief interview with [[Vigo Underswell]], [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]], [[Costi]], and [[Freya]]. 

Targeted questions:
- [[Costi]]: Rumors that an [[Eberron]] native involved is raising eyebrows - Underswell pushes him to stop. 
- [[Freya]]: Is she political? Does she have any special fondness for Zalev?

Then asked each of them to give a quick blurb on the work of the committee so far. Costi answered that he thinks the [[Zalevi Military]] should have more attention on the crimes their committing. Adrienne tried to soften that response.
