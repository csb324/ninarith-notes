# Kelpie "Kel"
[Status::alive]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Affiliation:: 
[Location:: [[Zalevi Embassy in Jalantar]]]
[Pronouns:: they/them]

They're tall, about 6'3. They have blue/green skin, with a lightly scaly texture. Normally has a slightly content grin plastered on their face. Long, matted dark black hair with streaks of blue (natural).

Former pirate who sailed with Captain Jesse [[Salvation Senderson]]

Kel was [[Niko]]â€™s main POC when he wanted to smuggle someone out of [[Zalev]]. Now, obviously, wanted by [[Zalevi Military]]. 

Loves beans, likes breaking bones? Months-to-years in prison seems to have done a number on their social skills. Or maybe they were always like that.

### Who's he to us? 
[[The Unforged Few]] freed him in the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]. He traveled with us to the [[Underground Safehouse]] and is currently helping bring [[Giary]] from the [[Jalantar Sewers]] to [[The Furnace]]
