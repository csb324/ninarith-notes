# Ulia Glorsbade
[Status::alive]
[Race::Halfling]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Jalantar]]]

We met at the sixes table at [[Seven Hooves]]. 

[[Dorian]] owes her money, but they seem to be friendly (sort of a mentor-mentee relationship).

She just opened a meadery in town -- [[Best Cask Mead]]. 

She's being investigated by the [[Fire Raisers]] as part of the [[Fire Raiser Baddie Audit]], mostly because she hasn't been seen since the [[Bellisme Show]]. [[Winifey]] let us know she might be at the [[Ruins of Fort Chyvensti]], between [[Jalantar]] and [[Arkhosia (City)]].
