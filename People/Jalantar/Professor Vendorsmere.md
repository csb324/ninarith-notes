# Professor Vendorsmere
[Status::alive]
[Race::Human]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Workplace::[[Redscale]]]
[Home::[[Jalantar]]]

An older human man, well postured, with a long silver ponytail.

A [[Redscale]] professor of sword skills and the arcane, has an office at the [[Burbank FIT]]. A follower of [[Oghma]] and friend of [[Father Thronestone]]. 

### Background
Been at the Academy for 7 or 8 years, used to teach at [[The Slavaadi College]]

Knows [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]], caught up with him and told [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] they met for lunch at the [[The Academy District]]. Plans to see him at the [[Bellisime]] concert later this week.  

### Who's he to us?
Training [[Costi]] in magical swordwork, gave him two spells to study: 
	Armor of Agathys 
	Mirror Image

Says Costi’s sword is a complicated enchantment and yet has something "empty" in the magic. Says he’s never encountered something like this before, and he’s seen his fair share of weapons.

Offered to connect [[Costi]] and [[Rez]] to colleagues in conjuration and transmutation at the [[The Slavaadi College]]
