[Home::[[Praise District]]]

A cleric at the [[Dragonsfire Forge]]. 

### Background
Learned to forge by mining his own metals and smelting them into a dagger, as part of the ritual process, in the [[Ragndaar Mountains]]

### Who's he to us?
He's teaching [[Rez]] how to pour iron, as she works off her debt for her face-repairs. He gave her his first successfully-made dagger, to inspire her.

He's also very interested in how the five-cup shuffle game at [[Seven Hooves]] works, so the two of them are also working on that puzzle.

Made us a replica ring, for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]] and told him it was for [[Rez]]. Also gave us led for a magical-concealment box, and other soft metals

Along with [[Ghez Yhutl]], looked into a metal containing some mithril that was attached to a dead blue dragon.

Forged the [[Scales of Chaos]] for [[Rez]].
