# Silverscale Ghez Yhutl
[Status::alive]
[Race::dragonborn]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Workplace:: [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]]]
[Affiliation:: [[Bahamut]]]
[Affiliation:: [[Order of the Platinum Dragon]]]
[Location:: [[Jalantar]]]
[Title:: Silverscale]
[Events:: [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]]

Blue dragonborn in silver robes with a staff, let us into the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]] where he is a Silverscale, a low ranking member of his organization. 

Silverscales are faces and welcoming committee in the OOTPD and also do lore. He was applying to the lore keeper program. Until he met us, that is.

Currently, on the run. Headed to [[Thelran Asari]], tracking down [[Pleetos Alentas]] and whoever he's working with. [[Rez]]'s assignment has given him purpose in life. 

### Who Is He to Us?
Gave us information about the big day of attacks in [[Jalantar]]

[[Rez]] [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] talked to him about [[Jorus]]. Says the OOTPD has people watching, convinved him this was a secret mission. Last Krokkiear of every month they have a dinner open to all for OOTPD interest. Code phrase it's okay to talk "can I interest you in a curious folio?" 

### [[Dragon Scales Ahhhh]]
A mid-level friar at [[Platinum Sanctuary of Jalantar]] named [[Nikander Vhegohl]] was acting suspicious, so [[Ghez Yhutl]] followed him for a few days. Eventually, he saw [[Nikander Vhegohl]] go into a building with a few folks, and before he went in he took off his holy symbol. [[Ghez Yhutl]] stuck around and waited for about an hour and a half, and could smell an almost ozone like scent drifting through the air periodically. [[Nikander Vhegohl]] and a few others left the building, but staggered, not together, and [[Ghez Yhutl]] snuck in. He found the corpse of a very young blue dragon in a cage, and it looked like it had a strange metal grafted onto its body. This is new and alarmingly different!! 

He took a sample and remembered [[Rez]] had mentioned [[Divitston Goldstone]]'s name once, assumed he could be trusted, and took it to him. [[Divitston Goldstone]] recognized the alloy, and they went to talk to the guy who likely made it, a blacksmith named [[Clive]]. They ended up walking in just as [[Clive]] was in the act of paying off a [[Dragon's Hide]] guard for illegally smuggling in contraband. Things escalated, and they killed the guard and [[Clive]]. [[Ghez Yhutl]] took the rap and intentionally got caught so [[Divitston Goldstone]] wouldn't be pursued, and then they snuck him in a shipment of candelabras going to [[Thelran Asari]] via airship. Now he's with [[Eirian]], and they're hot on the tail of [[Pleetos Alentas]].
