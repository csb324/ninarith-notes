Blue dragonborn in silver robes with a staff, let us into the [[Temple of  Platinum Dragon in Jalantar]] where he is a Silverscale, a low ranking member of his organization. 

Silverscales are faces and welcoming committee in the OOTPD and also do lore. He was applying to the lore keeper program. Until he met us, that is.

Currently, on the run. Headed to [[Thelran Asari]], tracking down [[Pleetos Alentas]] and whoever he's working with. [[Rez]]'s assignment has given him purpose in life. 

### Who Is He to Us?
Gave us information about the big day of attacks in [[Jalantar]]

[[Rez]] [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] and [[Freya]] talked to him about [[Jorus]]. Says the OOTPD has people watching, convinved him this was a secret mission. Last Krokkiear of every month they have a dinner open to all for OOTPD interest. Code phrase it's okay to talk "can I interest you in a curious folio?"
