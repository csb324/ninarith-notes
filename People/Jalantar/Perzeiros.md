Purple dragonborn. War mage, who casts through a dagger

Friends with a heavy armor wearing human, who made the inital ask for us to let them go. 

### Who Is He to Us?
Attacked us with [[Limley]], got scared and tried to run -- said they could keep their mouths shut, and that they plan to see with us soon
