# Finn El'Haliand
[Status::alive]
[Race::Half-Elf]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Zalev]]]
[Affiliation::[[Zalevi Military]]]
[Title:: Colonel]

Older human man, lighter skin (not Zalevi) graying hair and 5 o’clock shadow, wearing finery of [[Zalev]] government. 

### Background
A colonel in the [[Zalevi Military]], and [[Captain Fretze]]'s immediate superior. He's a [[Redscale]] alumnus, and a friend of [[Julian Slater-Runehorn]]. An incredible floutist, graduated with Julian. 

### Who's he to us?
Recognized [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] as his associate, and asked her to tell Julian "hello and that we’re owed a rematch"

Was present for the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]] and implied he was in [[Jalantar]] to oversee an operation that we assume was the capture of [[Niko]]. He was never seen by [[The Unforged Few]]
 during the conflict.

Sat at [[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]'s box at the [[Bellisme Show]] with [[Captain Fretze|Fretze]] and an [[Eberronian Military]] officer
