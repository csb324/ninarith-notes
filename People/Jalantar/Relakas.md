# Relakas Freed
[Status::alive]
[Race::Dragonborn]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Jalantar]]]
[Location:: [[Pent Logging]]
[Affiliation:: [[Dragon's Hide]]]

Large copper dragonborn, with teeth are filed down to points. Carries a greatsword.
 
Head of security at [[Pent Logging]], and has been known to travel as security with [[Norathar Pent]]. 

Seems to have some sort of feud with [[Limley]]

Old friend with [[Ricci Scrucks]]

### Background
Used to be part of the dragons hide - an elite regiment of the guards also known as the “hidesman”.

### Who's he to us? 
Flirted with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] at the [[Promenade Aid Society]] event, but also seemed sus. Was there when [[Costi]] stole her [[Ring of Efreet Summoning]] for [[Operation Incriminating Letters]]

In absentee will hear about [[Rez]] as a "woodworker courrier" at [[Pent Logging]] sent by [[Limley]]. Seems like they have beef.
