[Status::unknown]
[Race::Other]

A well known pirate, and the scourge of [[The Gilded Coast]]. She has a real Robin Hood vibe, or at least that's how she markets herself. Famous for mostly robbing Zalevi ships, has been extremely successful. Often serves are a privateer for warring governments, which means she's worked for most of the [[Southern Cities]] at one point or another.
