Welcome is from [[Thalfar]], and grew up in [[The Nine]]. She's always been interested in hospitality work, and really enjoys her job at the [[Chapel of the Lost]]. She likes reading, and we've bumped into her at [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]]. She's working on a story about a mermaid who drowns a prince, but then the father of the prince falls in love with the mermaid but also wants revenge? It's complicated.
