# Khequi
[Status::alive]
[Race::Aarakocra]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Arkhosia (City)]]]
[Affiliation::[[Fire Raisers]]]
[Workplace:: [[Kindness Kiln]]]

A white aarakocra with black tipped feathers pulled back into a psuedo-ponytail behind the bar. 

### Background
Works at the [[Kindness Kiln]] as a front for his work with the [[Fire Raisers]]. 

### Who're They to Us?
Told by [[Ulia Glorsbade]] that they're a point for the [[Fire Raisers]], awaiting with her next assignment. 

Gave us [[Ulia Glorsbade]]'s assignment, which included the [[Fire Raiser Cipher]] 

Told us he's not sure if [[Winifey|Winnie]] has made it town yet, but [[Flyte]] is where she'd be, though no one goes within 3-4 days of visiting him.
