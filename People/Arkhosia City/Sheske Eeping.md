# Sheske Eeping
[Status::dead]
[Race::unknown]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Halls of the Dead]]]

We are going to steal their mirrors. See also: [[Death Halls Heist]]

Eeping family unremarkable aside from being rich. Sheske was relatively close to [[Shorver Hoddlinston]]. When Sheske died, Shorver donated the big mirror to Sheske. Apparently Sheske  was very vain.
