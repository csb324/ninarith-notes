[Affiliation:: [[Fishermen]]

A big muscular half-orc. 

### Background
Became friends with [[Giary]] while joining in the fighting pits for the [[Fishermen]], and LOVES it. 

### Who's He to Us?
[[Freya]] and [[Hugh]] help him to learn that swimming can be hard and some folks can breath underwater. Naturally, they go up to the room to hold him underwater to see if the stress unlocks his ability to breath. The naturally, knock him unconscious. But boy it took a long time.
