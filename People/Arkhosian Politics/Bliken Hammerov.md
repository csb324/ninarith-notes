# Bliken Hammerov       

[Status::alive]
[Race::Dwarf]
[Relationship::neutral]
[Home::[[Zilvengrod]]]
[Location::[[Tinzelven]]]

[Affiliation::[[The Providers]]]
[Affiliation::[[Arkhosian Delegates]]]
[Location::[[Laborers Hall]]]
[Location::[[Bliken's Forge]]]

Renowned blacksmith in the [[Southern Cities]], based out of [[Tinzelven]]

He's an [[Arkhosian Delegates|Arkhosian Delegate]] (is this right? he and [[Victor]] are both delegates? that seems like a lot of delegates). He worships [[Moradin]], a dwarfish god of the forge.

He's real curious about [[Hugh]], especially after hearing about [[TrueSilver]]. 

- [x] buy some armor, maybe (medium!)
