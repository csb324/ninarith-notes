![[Hugh.jpg]]

A [Class::Cleric] of [[TrueSilver]].

Insists he's [[Costi]]'s dad. But also, wants to help Costi *FIND* his dad.

~~Has no memories beyond the last year or so~~ (someone went in and scrambled his brain around or something). In that time in between, he was in the [[Acedian Mountains]] at a forge, where he connected with [[TrueSilver]] (spiritually). Has a brand on his bicep from the [[Beating Heart Battalion]] 

**Update**: He got his memories back and his name is Finn now.

Likes to knit. Has knit many little hats for [[Nadia]]. Likes birds?

Knew [[Costi's Dad]] in the war, but his memory loss stops him from recalling the specifics. He did still have the [[Vlad Grosu Patch]], which he has given to [[Costi]] -- and he was unable to even read the writing on it. #mysteries 

His spiritual weapon is a flaming bird, or knitting needles, or perhaps a big bowl of soup.
