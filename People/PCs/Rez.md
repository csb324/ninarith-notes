#unforged-few

A prankster, the best in the world, actually. Loves riddles (so much that [[Hugh]] has promised to be a riddle-machine for her). A butthead.

Super incredibly talented and beloved by all. 

Rez grew up in a small town in northern [[Taleem]], but moved with her brother to [[Zalev]] for the vibes and the climate. 

She's a groupie (affectionate) for [[The Miscasts]] - as opposed to a groupie (derogatory).
