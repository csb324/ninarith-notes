# The Chapel of the Lost
Inn, [Location::[[Arkhosia (City)]]]

A luxury hotel, converted from a chapel to one of the true gods (k something). It's a massive glass pyramid in the [[Death halls]]. It has a gym.

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] is staying in the penthouse. He's paying for [[The Unforged Few]] to stay as well.
