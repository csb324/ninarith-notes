# The Chapel of the Lost
Inn, [Location::[[Arkhosia (City)]]]

A luxury hotel, converted from a chapel to one of the true gods - [[Kelemvor]]. It's a massive glass pyramid, adjacent to the [[Halls of the Dead]]. It has a gym. It also has a vault!

[[Julian Slater-Runehorn]] is staying in the penthouse. He's paying for [[The Unforged Few]] to stay as well.
