# Divian Wilds
District, [Location::[[Jalantar]]]

A huge park in the city of [[Jalantar]], between [[The Academy District]] and [[The Fallsides]]. 

Near a statue of a green dragonborn, the bird enthusiasts from [[The Black Gull]] get together and let their birds do bird things.

Representatives from [[Corellon's Grove]] hold hunts in the Divian Wilds, as a form of worship or communion or some such. They're also raising money to make the park more "inhabited".
