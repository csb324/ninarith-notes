# The Golden Gryffon
Hotel, [Location::[[The Academy District]]]

[[Willen Guruden]] has promised to pay for our stay, as long as we don't stay too long and embarrass him. Apparently it's a big [[The Guardians|Guardian party]] hangout. The dinner menu is prix fixe, and the concierge, [[Loomis]], seems like a nice fellow.

The night porter does not want to interact with the guests (or ghosts).
