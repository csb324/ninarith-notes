# Jalantar Sunspot
Place, [Location::[[Jalantar]]]

A small temple to Pelor, and a common place for people to stay on their way into [[Jalantar]]. Pelor is the patron god of the [[Wayfinders]], and seventeen Wayfinders are buried in this crypt. 

In the crypt, we met two shadowy spirits and one invisible grinning ghost. They seem to have been brought there by a [[Summoning Stone]].
