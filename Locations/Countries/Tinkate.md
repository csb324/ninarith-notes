# Tinkate
Country, [Location::[[Ninarith]]]

> The desert city-state of Tinkate, historically isolated and withdrawn from the affairs of the rest of the continent, has further withdrawn into itself since the Second Sundering. While travelers are sometimes welcome to partake of the vibrant markets lining the city's streets, much of the goings on in Tinkante remain a mystery.
