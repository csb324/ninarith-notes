# Devios
Country, [Location::[[Southern Cities]]]

Orcs and Hobgoblins live here. Together in peace? No. Absolutely not. Like [[Mulfara]], this nation was established when the nomadic life became too unstable for the monster races (or anyone, for that matter), after [[The Three Dragons War]].

> In the center of the country. Devios is controlled by the two cities of [[Haag Kitot]] (build out of the large orc encampment that survived the Three Dragons War) and [[Muulkan]] (which is run with an iron fist by the Iron Fist, a hobgoblin warlord).
