# Deregheir
Country, [Location::[[Ninarith]]]

As the [[Turian Waste|Wastes]] have retreated, civilization has stepped in. The Wanderers, left without a Waste to Wander, found a new purpose. After [[the Three Dragons War]], they, along with volunteers from the allied armies, established the outpost of [[Antaourth]] to watch and monitor the retreat the of the Wastes. Others joined them, and together they have turned the dead land into a new nation, Deregheir, dedicated to keeping [[Tiamat]]â€™s forces where they belong.
