# Thelran Asari
City, [Location::[[Narathian Plains]]]

> Thelran Asari continues to dominate the world’s political structure from its seat in the center of the rolling hills of the Narathian Planes. The extensive support they received after [[the Three Dragons War]], not to mention the extensive international clout they could throw around because of their deep connection to most of [[The Zumbinis|that war’s heroes]], established the city as a hub of diplomatic power they have been reluctant to let go.
