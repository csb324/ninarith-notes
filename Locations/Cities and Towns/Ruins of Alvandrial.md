# Alvandrial
Ruined City, [Location::[[Dilandil]]]

A city that was destroyed in [[The Three Dragons War]]. Or was it? Did that war (the one against [[Taleem]]) have a different name?  
- [x] ask joe if the war between tristaine and dillandil had a name. i feel like it probably did. unless it was all just one thing. 

Anyway. The city was destroyed by [[Taleem]]'s soldiers one way or another. It is now very spooky over there.

Nearby, [[Thelforiel]] sprung up in its absence.
