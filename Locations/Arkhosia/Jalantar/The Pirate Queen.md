# The Pirate Queen
Place, [Location::[[The Publics]]]

A massive theater (really a complex of theaters) in [[The Publics]] of [[Jalantar]]. 

Surrounded by a small moat that's accessible by paddle-boat (and many footbridges), It's shaped like a sinking ship, with a bust of [[Lillith Redscale]] on the bow. The ship has five distinct decks, each containing its own theater (and with its own crow's nest)

Has a grand aft bridge, where [[The Unforged Few]] entered. 

The main recieving chamber, Lillth Hall, is where the [[Bellisme Show]] was held
