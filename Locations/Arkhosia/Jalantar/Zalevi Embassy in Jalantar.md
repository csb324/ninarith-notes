Place, [Location::[[The Publics]]]

The embassy manages relationships between [[Zalev]] and [[Jalantar]]. 

[[Captain Fretze]] told [[Rez]] to meet him there so she can pick up her drawing! [[Niko]] said to be careful.

It is filled with beautiful artworks celebrating the might of the [[Zalevi Military]].
