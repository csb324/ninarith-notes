# St Jitterbig's Devotional Workshop
Temple, [Location::[[Praise District]]]

A temple to [[Helm]] in the [[Praise District]] of [[Jalantar]]. It looks like a big, confusingly modern office building.

Some of the folks there are very curious about warforged. Curious in a way that may or may not be safe for our friend [[Hugh]], but also may be helpful. 

[[Costi]] told [[Uulin]] that he knew his parents, that he was training to be an artificer, and that he had a job interview across town. Uulin helped make an appointment for [[Costi]] with [[Holy Maker Stormswallow]], in 32 days.
