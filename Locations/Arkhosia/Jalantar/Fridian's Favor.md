# Fridian's Favor
Tavern, [Location::[[The Academy District]]]

A slightly-off-campus tavern in [[The Academy District]]. It's nice, and performing there is a bit of a rite of passage for [[Redscale]] students.

Turns out, it's also a safe haven for [[The Stagehands|criminal types]], but ~~the [[Lish|bartender]] can be paid off~~. Or, he could, before he tried to extort us and we killed him. It turns out, the whole place was raided by the [[Jalantan Guard]] shortly after we left, and we were imagined to be involved somehow.
