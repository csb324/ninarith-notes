# Kildee's Ink and Quill
Store, [Location::[[Arkhosia (City)]]]
[Employees:: [[Kildee]]]

A used bookstore in [[Arkhosia (City)]], where [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] bought the [[The Unnatural Naturality]] in which you can find [[Freya's Mysterious Circles]] drawn. 

### What's It To Us?
[[Kildee]] told [[Freya]] he purchased [[The Unnatural Naturality]] from [[Caleb Schleuse]], who annotated it. He will reach out to make an introduction, and pass the info along to [[Welcome]], who likes to shop there.

Recommended to [[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] by [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]] and [[Welcome]]
