# The Kindness Kiln
Store, [Location::[[Arkhosia (City)]]]
[Affiliation:: [[Fire Raisers]]]
[Employees:: [[Khequi]]]

A pottery store that takes dangerous mining waste and turn it into plateware and other ceramics. Located near the gold mines in the [[Driftrock]] neighborhood of [[Arkhosia (City)]].

Oh, and it's also a front for the [[Fire Raisers]].

### What's it to us?
Where we met up with [[Khequi]] to intercept [[Ulia Glorsbade]]'s next assignment. Learned no one goes to both [[Kindness Kiln]] and [[Flyte]] within a 4 day period.
