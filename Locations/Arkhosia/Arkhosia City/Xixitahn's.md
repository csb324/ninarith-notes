#  Xixitahn's
Store, [Location::[[Arkhosia (City)]]]
[Affiliation:: [[Magister]]]
[Employees:: [[Xixitahn]]]

A magical scroll store in [[Arkhosia (City)]] recommended to us by [[Magister]]. Owned and operated by [[Xixitahn]].

### What's It To Us?
We traded in two scrolls of invisibility and earth bind in exchange for silence and countspell. [[Costi]] also got a scroll of borrowed knowledge.
