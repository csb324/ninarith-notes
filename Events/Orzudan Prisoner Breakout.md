# Orzudan Prisoner Breakout
[Affiliation::[[Eberronian Military]]]
[Affiliation::[[The Curator]]]

### What We Know
Framing them for the [[blacksite]] worked in our favor, but she's not sure what happened as a result of that attack was. She believes some prisoners were released, at least temporarily, from [[Orzudan]]. However, at least one person that she knew to be 'inactive', [[Dobosta Cumunzal]] is out and [[Clifford Burbank, the 5th|Fivey]] is out trying to bring her back in. She's a rogue necromancer who's done a lot of harm. It's been 9 years since she was heard from, but appeared in a village near [[Orzudan]].

### Those Involved
