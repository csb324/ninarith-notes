# Our mail is going missing
[Status::Ongoing]

Just feels worth noting. We asked [[Loomis]] about it in [[session-30]]. 

It's also possible people are just lying to us about trying to send us mail. 

### Examples
[[Vigo Underswell]] said he attempted to contact us to discuss the [[Zalevi Embassy Break-in]]

[[Rhy Zahn]] said he reached out regarding an interview for [[The Talon]]
