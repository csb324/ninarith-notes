#  Southern Cities Increase Tension
[Status::Ongoing]

[[El'Haliand]] told [[The Unforged Few|Our-Party]] about the ongoing craziness all over the [[Southern Cities]]. 

Apparently there have been fires in [[Arkhosia (City)]], caravans have been attacked in [[Zalev]], [[Mulfara]] is also having increased discontent, and pretty much everyone in the conversation expects tension and trouble between the [[Southern Cities]] to increase.

Are the [[Fire Raisers]] to blame or is something else going on?
