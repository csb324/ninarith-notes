# Weird boulder
[Status::Ongoing]
[Location::[[The Fallsides]] in [[The Tiamat House]]]

We found this weird boulder in [[Burru Ilp]]'s basement.

## Possible outcomes
- perhaps there's a silver dragon inside? [[Session-38]]
- There's a *rumor* that some dwarves turned a silver dragon into this weird boulder. 
	- It's not a rumor [[Rez]] says it's her sister [[Gin]]

Currently, [[Victoria Several]] owns the weird boulder, because she bought [[The Tiamat House]]. 

She took it to her families house in [[Quaath]]
