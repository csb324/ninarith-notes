#  Eberron-Arkhosia Cold War
[Status::Ongoing]

[Location::[[Eberron]]] and [Location::[[Arkhosia]]] aren't at war but they sure would like to kick someone's ass one of these days 

## Factors
Seems like they just fuckin hate each other

## Events
Oops, the [[People/Eberron/Burbanks|Burbanks]] covered our asses (and did a favor for [[Henrik]]/[[Julian Slater-Runehorn|Julian]]) by linking some [[Arkhosia]]s, and a member of [[The Listeners]], to a fake attack on a [[Eberronian Military]] [[Orzudan]] [[blacksite]].
