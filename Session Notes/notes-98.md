# Detailed Notes: Session 98

We arrive back at our hotel, and debrief. [[Hugh]] tries to scry on [[Shay]], he sees her walking through the streets of [[Viliki]], he notes a [[Building 17]], a nondescript house in the middle of a row. As she walks in, nothing really sticks out about the house. She pours a glass of wine and sits at a fire that's already lit. She looks satisfied, in general.
