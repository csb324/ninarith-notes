# Beating Hearts
[Affiliation:: [[Eberronian Second Division]]]
[Affiliation:: [[Eberronian Military]]]

A regiment within the [[Eberronian Military]]. 

### Background
This Eberronian battalion was well-known historically for a distaste of non-living humans. Seems like they push back strongly against use of any “non-souled creatures”, like Vampires but also maybe war-forged in more modern cases.

### Related Items
[[Hugh]] has a patch he believes is from [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]'s outfit that reads “Vladimir Grosu, corporal, beating hearts”.
