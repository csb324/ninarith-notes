# The Fishermen
[Location:: [[Arkhosia (City)]]]
[Relationship:: neutral]

The major thieves guild of [[Arkhosia (City)]]. Definitely working with the [[Fire Raisers]] in some capacity.

### Who're They to Us?
[[Giary]] is attempting to join and find out what he can about the [[Fire Raisers]] and the [[Cloud's Lament]].

They run an illegal fighting ring out of [[Fug Luggers]] - to gain access, you need to order ten whiskey shots. We're planning on fighting, to get some money to get us into the [[Halls of the Dead]] for the [[Death Halls Heist]].
