# Kith and Kin 
A a pulpy fiction novel about two half-elven siblings. Passed among several [[Wayfinders]], and given to [[Freya]] HEAVILY annotated by [[Rawley]] and maybe one other person? 

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] tries to puzzle out what these notes mean. 

### What We've Learned

Dragons is underlined and exclaimed on each of the pages with either help or protect struck-through. We confirm [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]] are assisting/assisted by dragon/s. 

We confirm something is hidden and related to [[The Zumbinis]]
* [[Rez]] remembers that the phrase  "Son of [[Thelran Asari]]i" is often coded to [[The Zumbinis]], who are deeply tied to it, no one member in particular (though [[Stalwart Mudd]] more than others)
* We know something is hidden IN [[Thelran Asari]] that is related to [[The Zumbinis]]. Don't believe a specific item is hinted at, but the word is portrait underlined as weighted and intentional. 

According to [[TrueSilver]] -
* Do dragons need to help or protect [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]? YES
* Are the [[Wayfinders]] who wrote the notes in [[Kith and Kin]] trying to help [[Bahamut]], [[Moradin]], [[Corellon Larethian]], and [[Pelor]]? I BELIEVE SO

Some pages flag the words: Everpresent, Eye, Time, and Space. It's also thematically tied to the character Culwin, though we're unsure what that is conveying. Maybe it references that he fought undead summoned by the ring Fracture?

### Other Clues
* There are two more substantials clues, that are discrete and singular, after we figure out the dots above letters thing 
* We have hit all the large Families of clues
