# Elemental Shield

[Owned by::[[The Unforged Few]]]
[Carried by::[[Freya]]]
[Origin::[[Fire Raisers]]]
[Attunement:: Yes]

Item, a simple, unadorned shield except for a small ruby placed squarely in its center. The metal, when you look closely, gives off a slight reddish hue. 

As a reaction, once per short rest, you can halve the damage from one melee, ranged, or spell attack. If that damage is fire damage, you can capture a portion of the flame and fling it at an enemy within 30 ft, dealing that target fire damage equal to the amount you took.
