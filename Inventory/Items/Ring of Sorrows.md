Item.

[Owned by::[[Samuel]]]
[Origin::[[Tack & Trade]]]

A small silver ring with three stones - red, blue, and green. 

> An older woman desperately needed passage out of town -- her husband had not been heard from in some time. She traded the ring for passage to her husbandâ€™s village. [[Abaria]] says she went to the town years later, a young man saw it on the stall and teared up.
