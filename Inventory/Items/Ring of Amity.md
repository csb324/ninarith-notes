# Ring of Amity

This silver ring is inscribed with the celestial word for "friend' on the outside and the draconic one on the inside. 

When you attune this ring, you touch a creature to band. Whenever you are subject to a spell or magic effect that restores HP, that creature receives the same benefits. Can change creatures after a long rest. Bond ends if creature leaves plane, or as bonus action. 

Additionally, once per day, when creature hits with as attack roll while you are within 60 ft, you can use your reaction to make the hit a crit.
