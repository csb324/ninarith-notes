[Origin::[[Father Thronestone]]]
[Attunement:: Yes]

Item, a needle with a ball of ink suspended at its base. 

Takes the form of a series of lines starting at the base of the wrist, running around of the hands, down the fingers, and coming to points underneath the fingernails. 

While attuned to the tattoo, your unarmed strikes are considered magical and gain a +1 bonus. As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. Each of your attacks can reach a target 15 feet away from you, and your attacks deal and extra 1d6 force damage. 

Once used, the tattoo cannot be re-empowered until the next dawn.
