# Potential

[Owned by::[[The Unforged Few]]]
[Carried by::[[Costi]]]
[Origin:: [[Costi's Dad|Vladdy Daddy]]]
[Status:: Active]

[[Costi]]'s sword from his father [[Costi's Dad|Vladimir Grosu]]. 

In the [[Halls of the Dead]], it lightens even further with an almost feathery flash of black feathers up the blade. For a fraction of a second, the metal turns green, and he feels a pulsing energy that he hasn't felt before - it calls to him. The sword has an idea of itself [[Potential]], that is now +1 weapon. 

[[Jade]] watches as this happens, and her glasses flash gray ([[Whats up with Jade's Glasses]]). She notices the color change, but sees it as two hues: a deep crimson and a royal purple, before flashing away. She pulls a notecard from her bag and gets [[Cinder]].
