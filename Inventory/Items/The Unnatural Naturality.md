A dense non-fiction book by T.Y. Gurscock, written in 1753.

### Background
Purchased in a used bookstore in [[Arkhosia (City)]]. called the  [[Kildee's Ink and Quill]] about 40 years ago by [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]. 

### What's It to Us?
Has the [[Freya's Mysterious Circles |Mysterious Circles]] symbol [[Freya]] cares about doodled in the margins. [[Niko]] asked [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]], who remembered seeing it here.

[[Jade]] learns a lot about the various hells and the origins of different planes. The Age of the Six true gods, and pre-material times. 

[[Jade]] learns that the Age of Six ended when the first of the [[The Ascended]] happened, who was [[Pelor]]. The second was [[Asmodeus]]. The new age was the Age of the Ascended or the Diedic Age. The mirror planes were borne out from the [[Prime Material]], [[The Shadowfell]], and [[the Feywild]]. On the [[Prime Material]], the various gods were originally mortal creatures who were from the original true gods [[Tyr]] [[Torm]] [[Bashaba]] [[Bane]]. From those lifeforms, some took on even more power. [[Asmodeus]] is one of the few to ascend outside of the [[Prime Material]]. It's unclear of the exact extent of creatures that Ascended, some might have privately. There's about 30/35 who are in the [[The Ascended]].
