# Rez's Riddle Machine

[Owned by::[[The Unforged Few]]]
[Carried by::[[Rez]]]
[Origin:: [[Professor Leonard Klipitz]]]
[Status:: Active]
[Attunement:: no]

It has two buttons, always press the right button and never the left (at risk of a hefty zap). Press the right button to get a riddle, answer and get a cookie.

### Riddles

What can you hold in your left hand but not your right? -- [[Costi]] with your right elbow
