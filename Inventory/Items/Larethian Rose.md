#  Larethian Rose

[Origin::[[Corellon's Grove]]]
[Status:: Gone]

A rare flower. These blue roses are a sign that [[Corellon Larethian]] is pleased. It is said that they bloom where he walks. 

Someone gave [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] one after she played the harp in [[Corellon's Grove]].

It doesn't wilt, as long as [[Corellon Larethian]] doesn't want it to.

[[The Unforged Few|Our Party]] lefit with [[Adrienne Spout|Adrienne]] while she rested.
